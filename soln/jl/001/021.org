* 21 Amicable numbers
Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n
which divide evenly into n).

If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are an amicable pair and
each of a and b are called amicable numbers.

For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55
and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and
142; so d(284) = 220.

Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.

** A:
This is actually a fairly straightforward problem if we have some way to look up
the sum of divisors for any number less than our upper limit. Firstly, we need
some way to sieve for the sum of divisors. The follow function accomplishes this
by iterating over all the divisors, adding itself and its quotient at all the
multiples.

#+begin_src jupyter-julia
"Sieve for the sum of proper divisors for natural numbers not exceeding ``n``."
function sumdivisors(n::T) where {T<:Integer}
    dsum = ones(T,n)
    dsum[1] = 0
    for i in 2:trunc(T,sqrt(n))
        dsum[i^2] += i
        for j in (i+1):trunc(T,n/i)
            dsum[i*j] += i+j
        end
    end
    return dsum
end

@test sumdivisors(10) == [0,1,1,3,1,6,1,7,4,8]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [32m[1mTest Passed[22m[39m

Now we can use this function to find all the amicable pairs under the chosen
limit. Since the array =dsum[a]= is analogous to the \(d(a)\) function in the
problem statement, let's define the amicable pair =(b,a)= as

1) =dsum(a)=b=
2) =dsum(b)=a=
3) =a>b=

Using this definition, we make sure to avoid counting perfect numbers, and make
sure that every pair we return is unique.

#+begin_src jupyter-julia
"Find all the amicable pairs less than ``n``."
function amicablepairs(n::T) where {T<:Integer}
    dsum = sumdivisors(n)
    pairs = T[]
    for a in 2:n
        if a > dsum[a] && dsum[dsum[a]] == a
            push!(pairs,dsum[a])
            push!(pairs,a)
        end
    end
    return pairs
end

@test amicablepairs(283) == Int[]
@test amicablepairs(284) == [220,284]

* 22 Names scores
Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 46K text file
containing over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it into alphabetical
order. Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this
value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.

For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is
worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would
obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.

What is the total of all the name scores in the file?

** A:
I hate text problems. First I need a way to map words to their values.

#+begin_src jupyter-julia
"Alphabetical value of a word. ``{'a'=>1,...,'z'=>26,'A'=>1,...,'Z'=>26}``."
value(word::String) = sum([(Int(c)-64)%32 for c in word])

@test value("colin") == value("COLIN") == 53

and finally scale the scores by their index.

* 23 Non-abundant sums
A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is exactly
equal to the number. For example, the sum of the proper divisors of 28 would be
1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, which means that 28 is a perfect number.

A number n is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than n
and it is called abundant if this sum exceeds n.

As 12 is the smallest abundant number, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, the smallest
number that can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers is 24. By
mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all integers greater than 28123 can
be written as the sum of two abundant numbers. However, this upper limit cannot
be reduced any further by analysis even though it is known that the greatest
number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two abundant numbers is less than
this limit.

Find the sum of all the positive integers which cannot be written as the sum of
two abundant numbers.

** A:
We start by finding all the abundant numbers, making sure to employ the sum of
divisors sieve from problem 21. We can also use a similar strategy for the
deficient numbers and perfect numbers, but that is beyond the problem scope.

#+begin_src jupyter-julia
"Find all the abundant numbers not exceeding ``n``."
function abundantnumbers(n::T) where {T<:Integer}
    dsum = sumdivisors(n)
    return T[i for (i, d) in enumerate(dsum) if i < d]
end

@test length(abundantnumbers(11)) == 0
@test abundantnumbers(12) == [12]
@test abundantnumbers(20) == [12,18,20]

@btime abundantnumbers(20161);
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

Now that we have the abundant numbers, we simply need to sieve over the abundant
numbers. According to [[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AbundantNumber.html][Wolfram Alpha]], the last number that we are searching for
is actually 20161. Although the final algorithm is faster, it is more
complicated. In order to be memory efficient, I had to loop over the indices of
=ab= in two nested loops, breaking when the sum exceeds the cache length.
Additionally, I preallocate =nonabsums= and iterate over the cache, keeping a
running index where the next hit will be assigned.

#+begin_src jupyter-julia

* 24 Lexicographic permutations
A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. For example, 3124 is one
possible permutation of the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4. If all of the permutations are
listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it lexicographic order. The
lexicographic permutations of 0, 1 and 2 are:

012   021   102   120   201   210

What is the millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8 and 9?

** A:
To solve this with brute force, we would iterate up to the \(k\)th permutation.
That's \(O(k)\) in run time, which is \(O(n!)\) for the worst case. However,
there's a combinatoric shortcut that lets us do this in \(O(n)\) time. I could
easily iterate through one million permutations, but it's not very hard to
generalize with that shortcut. Consider the characters \(a_1,a_2,...,a_n\).
We want the fastest way to find the \(k\)th lexicographic permutation of these
characters. First, consider how many permutations there are where \(a_0\) is the
leading character. 

\begin{eqnarray*}
a_1 a_2 \ldots a_{n-1} a_n \\
a_1 a_2 \ldots a_n a_{n-1} \\
\ldots \\
a_1 a_n \ldots a_2 a_3 \\
a_1 a_n \ldots a_3 a_2
\end{eqnarray*}

With \(a_1\) fixed, we have \(n-1\) more characters to permute, which gives
\((n-1)!\) ways to order the remaining characters. If and only if
\(k\leq(n-1)!\), we know that \(a_1\) must come first in the permutation. We
also know the \((n-1)!+1\)th permutation must begin with \(a_2\) since it
follows lexicographically.

\[ p_{(n-1)!}   = a_1 a_n \ldots a_3 a_2 \]

\[ p_{(n-1)!+1} = a_2 a_1 a_3 a_4 \ldots a_{n-1} a_n \]

Again, there are \((n-1)!\) consecutive permutations where \(a_1\) is the
leading character. In fact, for every \(a_i,i < n\), there are \((n-1)!\)
permutations where it is the leading character. This makes it very easy to
figure out what character is the leading character. Let \(a_i\) be the leading
character for the \(k\)th permutation. We can find \(i\) using the following
equation.

\[ i = \lfloor (k-1)/(n-1)! \rfloor + 1 \]

Let's test this on the example in the problem statement. What's the first
character in the 4th permutation of 1,2,3?

\[ i = \lfloor (4-1)/(3-1)! \rfloor + 1 = \lfloor 3/2 \rfloor + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \]

What's the first character in the 5th permutation of 0,1,2?

\[ i = \lfloor (5-1)/(3-1)! \rfloor + 1 = \lfloor 4/2 \rfloor + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 \]

Now we can figure out the first character with relative ease, but what about the
remaining characters? Well, if we consider the first character fixed, we now
have a new problem with only \(n-1\) characters. The problem is recursive. The
new \(k\) to feed into the next iteration of the algorithm is found by the
remainder after dividing by \((n-1)!\).

\[ k'-1 \equiv (k-1)\mod(n-1)! \]

Recursion is a crime against humanity, so here is the algorithm in a while loop,
and tests for all the problem statement examples.

* 25 1000-digit Fibonacci number
The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

\(F_n = F_{nâˆ’1} + F_{nâˆ’2}\), where \(F_1 = 1\) and \(F_2 = 1\).

Hence the first 12 terms will be:

\begin{eqnarray*}
F_1 = 1 \\
F_2 = 1 \\
F_3 = 2 \\
F_4 = 3 \\
F_5 = 5 \\
F_6 = 8 \\
F_7 = 13 \\
F_8 = 21 \\
F_9 = 34 \\
F_{10} = 55 \\
F_{11} = 89 \\
F_{12} = 144 \\
\end{eqnarray*}

The 12th term, \(F_{12}\), is the first term to contain three digits.

What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000
digits?

** A:
I went through a similar proof for problem 2 but since I originally wrote it for
this problem, and thus already had it written down, I've left it in. Consider
the formula for the \(n\)th Fibonacci number.

\[ F_n = \frac{\varphi^n-(-\varphi)^{-n}}{\sqrt{5}} \]

where \(\varphi=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\). There's a useful simplification we can
make if we look closely at the second term and substitute
\(-\varphi^{-1}=-0.618\).

\begin{eqnarray*}
F_n & = & \frac{\varphi^n}{\sqrt{5}} - \frac{(-\varphi^{-1})^n}{\sqrt{5}} \\
    & = & \frac{\varphi^n}{\sqrt{5}} - \frac{(-0.618)^n}{\sqrt{5}}
\end{eqnarray*}

Since \( \left| \frac{(-0.618)^n}{\sqrt{5}} \right| < \frac{1}{2} \) for all
\(n\geq0\), we can eliminate the second term and round to the nearest integer
with either the nearest integer function or the floor function.

\begin{eqnarray*}
F_n & = & \left[ \frac{\varphi^n}{\sqrt{5}} \right] \\
    & = & \lfloor \frac{\varphi^n}{\sqrt{5}} + \frac{1}{2} \rfloor
\end{eqnarray*}

If we want a number above a lower bound \(L\), then \(F_n\geq L\).

\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{\varphi^n}{\sqrt{5}} & \geq & L \\
                 \varphi^n & \geq & \sqrt{5}\cdot L \\
               n\ln\varphi & \geq & \frac{1}{2}\ln5+\ln L \\
                         n & \geq & \frac{\frac{1}{2}\ln5+\ln L}
                                         {\ln\varphi} \\
                         n & =    & \lceil \frac{\frac{1}{2}\ln5 + \ln L}
                                                {\ln\varphi} \rceil

* 27 Quadratic primes
Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:

\[ n^2+n+41 \]

It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive integer
values \(0\leq n\leq39\). However, when \(n=40\), \(40^2+40+41=40(40+1)+41\) is
divisible by 41, and certainly when \(n=41\),\(41^2+41+41\) is clearly divisible
by 41.

The incredible formula \(n^2-79n+1601\) was discovered, which produces 80 primes
for the consecutive values \(0\leq n\leq79\). The product of the coefficients,
âˆ’79 and 1601, is âˆ’126479.

Considering quadratics of the form:

\(n^2+an+b\), where \(|a| < 1000\) and \(|b|\leq1000\)

where \(|n|\) is the modulus/absolute value of \(n\)
e.g. \(|11|=11\) and \(|âˆ’4|=4\)

Find the product of the coefficients, \(a\) and \(b\), for the quadratic
expression that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of
\(n\), starting with \(n=0\).

** A:
For \(n=0\), we have

\begin{eqnarray*}
0^2 + a\cdot 0 + b & = & p \\
                 b & = & p
\end{eqnarray*}

where \(p\) is prime. Since \(b=p\), \(b\) is also prime. For \(n=1\) we have

\begin{eqnarray*}
1^2 + a\cdot 1 + b & = & p \\
         1 + a + b & = & p
\end{eqnarray*}

Since \(b\) must be odd, \(b+1\) must be even, and \(a\) must be odd.
Additionally, \(a > -b\). With our search space reduced, we simply must use
brute force search to find the answer.

* 28 Number spiral diagonals
Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5
by 5 spiral is formed as follows:

#+begin_example
21 22 23 24 25
20  7  8  9 10
19  6  1  2 11
18  5  4  3 12
17 16 15 14 13
#+end_example

It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.

What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed
in the same way?

** A:

Notice how the top right corner of each minor square is the square of an odd
integer (\(1^2,3^2,5^2,\ldots\)) corresponding to the size of the square. So if
we consider an arbitrary \(n\times n\) spiral matrix,

\[\begin{bmatrix}
    c_2    & \dots  & c_1    \\
    \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    c_3    & \dots  & c_4 
  \end{bmatrix} \]

we can write all of the corner values in terms of the size,
\(n > 1, n \equiv 1 \mod 2\). Additionally, we can write the sum of these
corners, \(C_n\), in terms of the size.

5\begin{eqnarray*}
c_{n,1} & = & n^2 \\
c_{n,2} & = & n^2 - (n-1) \\
c_{n,3} & = & n^2 - 2(n-1) \\
c_{n,4} & = & n^2 - 3(n-1) \\
C_n     & = & 4n^2 - 6n + 6
\end{eqnarray*}

We have to recognize the special case, \(C_1 = 1\). For an arbitrary square of
size \(n\equiv1\mod2\), the diagonal total, \(D_n\), is

\begin{eqnarray*}
D_n & = & 1 + \sum_{i\in\{3,5,\ldots,n\}} \left( 4i^2 - 6i + 6 \right) \\
    & = & 1 - 4 + \sum_{i\in\{1,3,5,\ldots,n\}} \left( 4i^2 - 6i + 6 \right) \\
    & = & 3(n+1) - 3 + \sum_{i\in\{1,3,5,\ldots,n\}} \left( 4i^2 - 6i\right) \\
    & = & 3n + 4\left(\sum_{i\in\{1,3,5,\ldots,n\}} i^2\right) - 6\left(\sum_{i\in\{1,3,5,\ldots,n\}} i\right) \\
\end{eqnarray*}

The second sum looks like an odd version of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number][triangular numbers]].

\begin{eqnarray*}
\sum_{i\in\{1,3,5,\ldots,n\}} i 
& = & \sum_{i=1}^n i - \sum_{i\in\{2,4,6,\ldots,n-1\}} i \\
& = & \sum_{i=1}^n i -  \sum_{i=1}^{(n-1)/2} 2i \\
& = & T_n -  2T_{(n-1)/2} \\
& = & \frac{n(n+1)}{2} -  2\frac{((n-1)/2)((n+1)/2)}{2} \\
& = & \frac{2n^2+2n}{4} - \frac{n^2-1}{4} \\
& = & \frac{n^2+2n+1}{4} \\
& = & \left(\frac{n+1}{2}\right)^2 \\
\end{eqnarray*}

The first sum looks like an odd version of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_pyramidal_number][square pyramidal numbers]].

\begin{eqnarray*}
\sum_{i\in\{1,3,5,\ldots,n\}} i^2
& = & \sum_{i=1}^n i^2 - \sum_{i\in\{2,4,6,\ldots,n-1\}} i^2 \\
& = & \sum_{i=1}^n i^2 - \sum_{i=1}^{(n-1)/2} (2i)^2 \\
& = & P_n - 4P_{(n-1)/2} \\
& = & \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} -  4\frac{((n-1)/2)((n+1)/2)(n-1+1)}{6} \\
& = & \frac{2n^3+3n^2+n}{6} - \frac{n^3-n}{6} \\
& = & \frac{n^3+3n^2+2n}{6} \\
& = & \frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6} \\
\end{eqnarray*}

And the final formula is

\begin{eqnarray*}
D_n & = & 3n + 4\left(\frac{n^3+3n^2+2n}{6}\right) - 6\left(\frac{n^2+2n+1}{4}\right) \\
    & = & \frac{18n}{6} + \frac{4n^3+12n^2+8n}{6} - \frac{9n^2+18n+9}{6} \\
    & = & \frac{4n^3+3n^2+8n-9}{6} \\
    & = & \frac{n(n(4n+3)+8)-9}{6} 
\end{eqnarray*}

where the last expression was derived from WolframAlpha.

* 29 Distinct powers
Consider all integer combinations of \(a^b\) for \(2\leq a\leq5\) and
\(2\leq b\leq5\):

\[
2^2=4, 2^3=8, 2^4=16, 2^5=32 \\
3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243 \\
4^2=16, 4^3=64, 4^4=256, 4^5=1024 \\
5^2=25, 5^3=125, 5^4=625, 5^5=3125
\]

If they are then placed in numerical order, with any repeats removed, we get the
following sequence of 15 distinct terms:

4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 64, 81, 125, 243, 256, 625, 1024, 3125

How many distinct terms are in the sequence generated by \(a^b\) for
\(2\leq a\leq100\) and \(2\leq b\leq100\)?

** A:
Easy by brute force and a set.

#+begin_src jupyter-python
powers = set()
for a in range(2,101):
    for b in range(2,101):
        powers.add(a**b)
print(len(powers))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 9183

The brute force solution is fine for Project Euler, but the HackerRank version
has much more difficult test cases. 

The only way to assure that our terms are unique is to express them in terms of
irreducible bases. Let \(S=\{a^b:a,b\in\{2,...,n\}\}\). Consider \(a^b\in S\)
where \(a\) is not a perfect power. Then \(a^b=(a'^k)^b=a'^{kb}\). The
representation is not unique. Therefore, the representation \(a^b\) is unique if
and only if there are no integers \(a',k\) such that \(a=a'^k\).

With this in mind, I first build a set of all the perfect powers. Second, I
build a dictionary where keys are the maximum possible \(k\) of an irreducible
base and the values are the number of \(kb\) that are valid for that maximum
\(k\). Lastly, for each base that is not a perfect power, I add to a running
total the number of valid \(kb\), where \(k=\lfloor\log_a n\rfloor\).

        exp[k] = len(exp[k])

    count = 0
    for a in range(2,n+1):
        if a not in pp:
            count += exp[int(log(n,a))]

    return count

This method is the only efficient way I found to do large limits. Note that for
some specific \(n\), floating point error in =log(n,a)= results in the wrong
answer.

* 30 Digit fifth powers
Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of
fourth powers of their digits:

\begin{eqnarray*}
1634 = 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4 \\
8208 = 8^4 + 2^4 + 0^4 + 8^4 \\
9474 = 9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4 \\
\end{eqnarray*}

As \(1 = 1^4\) is not a sum it is not included.

The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.

Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers
of their digits.

** A:
At first, I had generated bounds for the number and checked if every number in
those bounds were equal to the fifth power of their digits. This was fine for
PE, but HackerRank asks for sixth powers, which timed out the old
implementation. My new method also uses bounds to restrict the search space, but
instead of checking through every number in the bounds, I check combinations of
digits.

Let \(N\) be an \(n\) digit number.

\[ 10^{n-1} \leq N < 10^n \]

And let the sum of the \(3\leq p\leq 6\) powers of the digits be equal to \(N\).

\[ N = d_1d_2\dots d_n = d_1^p + d_2^p + \dots + d_n^p \]

A digit can only take values \(0,1,\dots,9\) so that enforces another upper
bound.

\[ N \leq n(9^p) \]

For now, we've fixed the digits. But these can change. We know \(n\geq2\) from
the problem statement. We also know that \(O(10^{n-1}) > O(n(9^p))\). Therefore,
there will be some \(n'\) that results in \(n'(9^p)\leq10^{n'-1}\). There can be
no candidates that are \(n'\) digits long. 

With this information, the problem is solved in two steps. First, I iterate
through \(n\) until I find the first \(n'\). Then, I iterate through
\(n=2,\ldots,n-1\), and for each length of digits iterate through the
combinations, with replacement, of \(2\leq n < n'\) digits to their \(p\)
powers. With =str= sorting and comparison, hits are easy to check.

#+begin_src jupyter-python
def pe030(p):
    """Find all the numbers whose digits to the ``p``th power is that number."""
    numbers = []
    power = [i**p for i in range(10)]

    nmax = 2
    limit = nmax*power[-1]
    while 10**(nmax-1) < limit:
        nmax += 1
        limit = nmax*power[-1]

    for n in range(2,nmax):
        for c in combinations_with_replacement(range(10),n):
            n = sum([power[d] for d in c])
            n_str = str(n)
            if n > 0 and len(n_str) == len(c):
                if ''.join(sorted(n_str)) == ''.join(map(str, c)):
                    numbers += [n]

    return sorted(numbers)
